# Sketch
Sketch is an incredibly powerful tool for creating digital interfaces. We love it because it enables us to iterate quickly and move from lo-fi to hi-fi with ease.

There are ton of resources for learning the ins and outs of Sketch, here are 2:

Here are few things that will help you when using Sketch for a NewSpring project.


#### Styleguides
A styleguide or component library will allow you to move much faster because you can access the existing components we have already defined. We have two styleguide template files in dropbox, one for desktop, and one for mobile. The mobile file is adjusted to be @2x for retina screens. When starting a new project copy and paste the artboards from the template file into your new project file. This will instantly transfer over the text and object styles to your new document.

With this setup, when you begin to create pages it will be much easier to style them using the imported library by applying the text or object style to your elements. 
> A word of caution: changing the attributes of an item with global styles will update those attributes for every item in your file with those styles.


#### 	Plugins
Sketch supports the ability to write custom plugins to supplement the existing functionality. There are a whole host of plugins available that will help streamline your workflow, some of the most important are detailed below:

##### [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com/)
This should be the first plugin you download as it is a package manager to search and install available plugins.

##### Content Generator
This plugin provides a quick way to input dummy data and images. Iâ€™ve found it most helpful for generating copy and images when quickly creating page elements. Adding real data can come at a later time as you refine your designs, but for moving quickly and getting ideas out, this plugin is great.

##### Duplicator
Duplicator allows you to quickly take the currently selected layers and copy them once or multiple times in a specified direction, with a specified distance between them. 

##### Cemre
This has a few different action associated with it. However, I primarily use it for the Swap Position feature. It allows you to very quickly exchange the positions of elements on the page.

##### Sketch Measure
This plugin is very useful for providing the details of size, padding etc for your design much like a CAD drawing. This will be shown in more detail under the chapter on handing off your design. 

#### 	Mirror
Another extremely useful tool Sketch offers is Mirror, an accompanying app to mirror your artboards on your iOS devices. This is invaluable in providing instant context when creating either iPhone or iPad designs. It acts as a helpful bridge to inform your design choices before you move to creating a prototype in Invision.
