# Sketch
Sketch is an incredibly powerful tool for creating digital interfaces. We love it because it enables us to iterate quickly and move from lo-fi to hi-fi with ease.

There are ton of resources for learning the ins and outs of Sketch, here are 2:

Here are few things that will help you when using Sketch for a NewSpring project.


#### Styleguides
A styleguide or component library will allow you to move much faster because you can access the existing components we have already defined. We have two styleguide template files in dropbox, one for desktop, and one for mobile. The mobile file is adjusted to be @2x for retina screens. When starting a new project copy and paste the artboards from the template file into your new project file. This will instantly transfer over the text and object styles to your new document.

Having set this up, when you start to create pages itâ€™s easy to style them based on the imported library by applying the text  or object style to your elements. 
> A word of caution: changing the attributes of an item with global styles will update those attributes for every item in your file with those styles.
