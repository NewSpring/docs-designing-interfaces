# Lookback
Lookback is a tool that enables us to record the screen, audio, and video from a testing device. It is used in conjunction with the Invision prototype as the key piece for usability testing. 


There are currently 2 ways to use Lookback. 
1. The first is through the Invision iOS app
2. The second is to jailbreak the device and install the lookback app. [Learn more here](https://lookback.io/learn/lookback-for-your-ios-device/installing-lookback)


We use internal devices for testing, so there is no issue in jailbreaking. This is fortunate because at present the jailbroken app is far more stable and performant than their collaboration with Invision.

Once your test is complete simply upload the recording, ensuring you rename the file with the name of the tester to aid when reviewing.
