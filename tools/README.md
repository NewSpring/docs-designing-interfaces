# Design Tools

We are blessed to have access to many different tools for crafting our designs. Providing tools for digital designers is a burgeoning industry which makes it an exciting time to be creating products. At the NewSpring web team we want to use the right tool for the right application, so we can move as fast and as excellently as possible.

As such, this list may be subject to change as we see the next generation of tools hit the market. Currently the tools we use are as follows.

1. Sketch
2. Invision
3. Lookback

#### Sketch
We use Sketch by Bohemian Coding to create our hi-fi designs. It was specifically built for designing digital interfaces and has been widely adopted across the web by many high profile companies such as Facebook and Google.


#### Invision
When we have finished our interfaces in Sketch we upload them to Invision, a browser based application for prototyping. Invasion allows us to connect all the artboards together to make a working prototype for our usability testing. 

#### Lookback
We use Lookback in conjunction with Invision for testing. Lookback allows us to record a device’s screen, while also capturing video and audio using the device’s camera and mic. This is incredibly useful for capturing our testing sessions so we can revisit them later for analysis.
