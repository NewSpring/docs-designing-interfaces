# Lo-Fi Reviews

The lo-fi review is the first time in the design process you will get back with the team. This is a time to go over the drawings and present the user-flows that have been created. Reviewing at this early stage is useful as it keeps the feedback loop small and keeps everyone on the team involved and excited.

There are two main goals for this review:

1. **Visual Clarification**

	The lo-fi drawings demonstrate an ability to understand what the problem is, not just for the design team, but for all involved. It allows the team to come together and all agree; yes, this is how we all understand the problem and this is the best direction for solving it.

2. **Directional Decisions** 

	The result of this review should be that the design team has a concrete direction to take the next leap into hi-fi designs. Creating hi-fi designs comes at a much higher time cost than lo-fi so itâ€™s imperative the direction is nailed down. 

There may be times when it is necessary to go back and do another round of lo-fi designs. If this happens more than once, it may be instructive to re-visit the User Story Mapping as there probably needs to be greater clarity on what exactly the problem is.
