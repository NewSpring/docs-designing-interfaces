# Design Reviews

One of the great aspects of working on a team such as the NewSpring web team is the kind of collaboration that exists. This collaboration and melting pot of ideas, skills, and differing perspectives, makes the end result far superior than if working in isolation. Design reviews are a huge part of working together to refine our end product.

In order to save us time moving too far in the wrong direction,  design reviews happen at every major stage of the design process. The two key goals in reviewing the design are:

- Comparative analysis
- Pixel intent


#### Comparative Analysis
This involves comparing the proposed solution against the problem(s) outlined from the User Story Mapping session. Doing this keeps us on track and laser focused on directly solving the problems at hand.


#### Pixel Intent
The goal of this exercise is to ensure every pixel has clear intentions. We must be able to communicate the ‘why’ behind each design choice we have made. This forces us to get the clarity and feedback necessary to make informed choices on every aspect of our designs.
