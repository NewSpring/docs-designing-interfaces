# Design Reviews

One of the great aspects of working on a team such as the NewSpring web team is the kind of collaboration that exists. This collaboration and melting pot of ideas, skills, and differing perspectives, makes the end result far superior than if working in isolation. Design reviews are a huge part of working together to refine our end product.

In order to save us time moving too far in the wrong direction,  design reviews happen at every major stage of the design process.
