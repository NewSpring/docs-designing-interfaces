# Testing Reviews

The final time we conduct a review is as part of the usability testing post mortem. It is almost impossible to walk away from usability testing without anything to improve upon. However, if we are successful then the feedback should be overwhelmingly of an iterative, progressive nature, rather than a revolutionary change. 

The goals for this review:

1. **Reaffirm Solution**
The usability testing will hopefully confirm our attempt at solving the problem, albeit with areas to improve.

2. **Establish Actionable Items**
We should have a prioritized list of actionable items to improve  our hi-fi designs.

3. **Approve For Export**
If our usability test is a rousing success and the team is confident the problem has been adequately solved then the designs should be approved for export. 


The process of adjustment and testing may be repeated several times as we work to find the best solution. However, if there are large scale changes in our approach it may be instructive to go back a step and revisit the lo-fi designs if a change in direction is needed.
