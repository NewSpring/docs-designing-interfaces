# Hi-Fi Reviews

The second time we conduct a design review is at the end of the hi-fi designs. This may require exporting the current artboards. This should be a high quality visual confirmation of everything discussed from the first review. Where possible, it should be content relevant to give the team as much context as possible.

The goal for this review:

1. **Confirm Solution**

	The hi-fi designs represent the complete thought of the agreed upon solution. 

2. **Approve For Prototypes**

	The result of this review should be that the design team has concrete approval on the hi-fi designs. We need this decision made so we can take the next step into prototyping. 

There may be times when it is necessary to go back and make adjustments to the hi-fi designs. If this happens more than once, it may be instructive to go back a step and revisit the lo-fi designs if a change in direction is needed.
