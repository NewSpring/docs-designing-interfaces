# Handoff

Once the designs have been tested and approved the final step in the process is to hand off all the necessary assets to the development team. This is an amazing opportunity to build trust and equity with the development team. It is important to finish the process strong.

Handing our assets off is centered around 2 core tasks:

- Naming conventions
- Exporting

#### Naming Conventions
This is the cornerstone of handing off assets. Getting this right from the beginning will set you up for a smooth export process.

#### Exporting
Setting aside ample time for a great export is vital to ensuring you communicate the necessary details. It is the best time for going above and beyond in making sure whoever develops your designs feels valued and taken care of.
