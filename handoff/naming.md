# Naming Conventions

This is a task that takes relatively little time, but it works best when integrated throughout your process of creating hi-fi designs. 

#### How It Works
When you create your new artboard ensure it is set to export with a set background color. This will help you batch export later, without having to go back through every artboard.

##### Naming Artboards
Rename your artboards as you create new ones to keep things organized and easy to follow.

- Device_name
- Webpage_name
- Number

So, you use _ for related words and - to separate the 3 sections.

Put together this would be:
iPhone_6-home-1


##### Naming Elements
This same approach can also be used when naming and exporting page elements.

- Device_name
- Webpage_name
- Element_name
- Number

Put together this would be:
iPhone_6-home-feed_img-1
