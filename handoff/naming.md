# Naming Conventions

This is a task that takes relatively little time, but it works best when integrated throughout your process of creating hi-fi designs.


#### Naming Artboards
Rename your artboards as you create new ones to keep things organized and easy to follow.

- Device_name
- Webpage_name
- Number

So you use _ for related words and - to separate sections.

Put together this would be:
iPhone_6-home-1


#### Naming Elements
This same approach can also be used when naming and exporting elements.

- Webpage_name
- Element_name
- Number

Put together this would be:
home-article_img-1
