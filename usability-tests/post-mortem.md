# Post Mortem

Now that the testing is over, the real fun begins! Time to slice up all that feedback and see how the product held up. Go ahead and prepare yourself, the post mortem takes a good chunk of time. All your hard work up to this point will have been for nothing if you don’t take the time for thorough analysis, so set aside the time necessary.

#### What You’ll Need
- The decision makers or stakeholders. Ideally this should be the same group of people who met for the user story mapping.
- Pens for each person
- Markers for each person
- Notepads for each person
- Sticky notes for each person

#### Watch And Write
With the whole team together you will watch through every user test video from Lookback. Working individually, write down any and all observations from their feedback on the notepad. The sticky notes should be used to write down any actionable items during the test. For example:

*Make the logo bigger, or call to actions should be more visible*.

#### Chat And Stick 'Em
Once you’ve gone through making notes and actionable item stickies on every video it’s time to talk as a team. Using a white board list out the key pages or areas of the product. Now, talk through the notes you have compiled for each user, add any stickies on the board beneath their respective areas. Talking through all the feedback enables everyone to see what worked and what didn’t.

You should now be able to get a great perspective on the actionable items for each area. The team should then prioritize these items based on the requirements for the project. The end goal for prioritization is to provide the design team with the items that need to be improved upon first. Invariably, this will lead us back to the hi-fi stage of the design process to make adjustments. However, there may be some cases we need to revisit either lo-fi or story mapping if the product really hasn’t achieved the stated aims.
