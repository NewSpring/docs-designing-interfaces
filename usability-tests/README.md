# Running Usability Tests

Regularly testing our digital products with real users is vital to the iterative process. The information we gain is invaluable to delivering the right feature set at the right time. As such, we must ensure we conduct our tests to gather the best information possible. 

We currently have 3 major components to our usability testing:

1. Preparation
2. Testing
3. Post Mortem

#### Preparation
- Build and thoroughly test the prototype.
- Get people scheduled.
- Ensure the testing room is ready.


#### Testing
- Set the stage with each tester.
- Know how to answer questions.


#### Post Mortem
- Analyze each video
- Make notes on any feedback
- Make notes on actionable changes
- Prioritize changes
