# Testing 1, 2, 3

If you are well prepared then the actual testing should be relatively straightforward. If possible try and memorize what you want each tester to do, this will help you to be more natural and avoid having a script. There are two main approaches  that will enable you to elicit great responses, setting the scene for the test, and plausible deniability. 

#### Setting The Scene
It’s important to communicate upfront with each user so they are clear on the expectations for the test. Let them know that we will be recording their voice, their actions on screen and a video of their reactions. Some people find this invasive, so it is important to reassure them it is only for our records so we can review, analyze and revisit their insight at a later date.

Help set their expectations for the performance of the product low to avoid feedback that isn’t important. The reality is the prototype will not be as fast or responsive as the real product, so it’s important to let the user know to be patient as they interact with it, but that this will be ‘fixed’ in production.

#### Plausible Deniability
What this boils down to is the ability, like a good therapist,  to answer every question with another question. You lay the foundation for this when setting the scene for the test by disassociating yourself from the product. This can be achieved by using the language of team, for example:

“*The team has been working on a new product and has asked me to run the testing sessions. I will try to answer any questions you have, but I know about as much as you do*.”

With this expectation established it allows you to brush off questions about how the user interface works giving nothing away. The best question you can ask is:

*“Well, is that how you think it should work?”*

The whole goal behind ‘plausible deniability’ is to be able to illicit valuable feedback from the user. We won’t be able to get this kind of feedback if we continually explain for them how the product should work. The whole point of our design process is to create something that in most cases, works so simply, it needs no explanation.
