# Preparation

Preparation is the key for the entire testing exercise. As much as possible we try to maintain the illusion that the user is interacting with the real product, even though we know it’s a simply screens linked together. If we can maintain this illusion of an early version of the real product it makes the feedback much greater.

This starts with the attention to detail in your Invision prototype. There are many great tutorials on how to use Invision (here is [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNoBmjg-NnQ)). The nuts and bolts of using Invision are fairly simple, but there are a couple of important things to bear in mind.

- **Create A New Sketch File**

	You’ll want to create a new Sketch file for your Invision project. This allows you to keep your working file separate from the prototype that will be synced with the users device. It also allows you to only pull in device specific artboards. In creating your hi-fidelity designs it is common to create them for multiple screen sizes in the same document. However, when syncing to Invision I have found it best to avoid these kinds of duplicate artboards, especially given that Invision requires you to choose the device size when creating a new project.

- **Establish User Pathways**

	Oftentimes when designing our hi-fi screens we approach them as static pages. When it comes to creating our prototype, we must ensure users get a fluid experience with screens connecting together appropriately and, where possible, containing accurate content. This can mean duplicating artboards of the same page type, such as an article, and filling them in with different content. Taking the time to pay attention to these small details is what makes the difference when users interact with the prototype.


- **Mind The Gaps**

	When we are testing it is not typically realistic to think we will have the entire app designed. We are often testing a specific area of our designs to assess our assumptions. This will invariably mean there are holes in our prototype with areas that will have functionality that does not exist yet. We must take care of these areas so there is nothing left to the users imagination. This means where there is missing functionality adding in overlays or additional pages to let them know this functionality or page is not ready yet. You’ll be surprised at how much negative feedback and confusion this helps to alleviate.


#### Testing The Test
When you are confident the prototype is ready, have a couple of colleagues run through it and look for any glaring errors. You should be on the look out for:
- Missing Content
- Pages linked incorrectly
- Inconsistent animations
- Missing user feedback (i.e. coming soon overlays)

#### Schedule
Once the prototype is finished, schedule your testers. We have been using a Google spreadsheet for internal testing, where team members can register for a time convenient to them. Depending on the extent of your prototype you might need anywhere from 5-30 minutes, so plan out your day accordingly with accompanying time slots.

#### Prepping The Room
As with most things, location is a big deal. Users should feel safe, comfortable, and have the space to think as they interact with your prototype. Find a quiet room with some comfortable seating, or a desk, if you are using a desktop prototype. Finding somewhere you won’t be interrupted is important in maintaining the persons focus and also for the quality of your Lookback recording. For mobile devices make sure you have a charger as the act of using the prototype and running Lookback in the background is fairly power intensive.
