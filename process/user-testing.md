# User Testing

Testing is the last step in the design process before either circling back to an earlier step or readying the design for handoff to the development team. It enables us to assess whether or not our attempt to solve the design problems outlined from our user story mapping is up to snuff. 


#### Selecting The Test Group
It is important to try and select a test group that is representative of the vast nature of the NewSpring demographic. Staff members are the easiest to test, however having a good mix of ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ will help normalize the test results. 


#### Lookback To Look Forward
We use a service called [Lookback](https://lookback.io) in conjunction with our Invision prototype to run our user testing. Lookback records the devices screen, but also utilizes the mic and camera to record the users face and voice. This is incredibly useful when it comes time to assess the results of the test. It enables the person running the test to be present in the moment without worrying about annotating their observations.
