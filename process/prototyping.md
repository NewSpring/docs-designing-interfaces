# Prototyping

Once you have a completed version of your hi-fi design, it is time to turn those pretty pictures into a workable prototype. Creating a prototype that, as much as possible, mimics real functionality with real content is incredibly important. This can sometimes be tedious, time consuming work, however it’s importance cannot be understated for 2 main reasons:

1. **Prototypes are sent to DLT members**. We do this because it provides the web team with a tremendous amount of equity with leadership and allows them to get excited about the sometimes intangible aspects of our work. 

2. **Prototypes are used for usability testing**. We want to ’trick’ our testers into believing they’re interacting with an early version of the finished product. This is vital in getting the kind of actionable feedback instructive to our continued iteration of the product.  


#### Invisioning The Future
We are currently using [Invision](http://invisionapp.com) for our prototyping. It gives us the flexibility to send a live link to any device, which will then update with adjustments on the fly.  

You will sync your Sketch file with Invision and link all the pages together to create a seamless experience. Ensure the pathways through the product are complete enough for users to adequately explore or test the desired feature. 

> Documentation on the direct implementation of Invision can be found later in this guide.
