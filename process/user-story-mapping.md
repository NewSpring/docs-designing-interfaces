# User Story Mapping

The first stage to discovering what you are going to design is user story mapping. A user story defines a function from the perspective of the user. 
> For example: as a user, I need to know when a service is live so I can watch as itâ€™s happening.


#### Why We Do It
Defining user stories gives you a compass to determine the direction your design should take. It also helps to protect against scope creep with the stories providing the basis of your minimum viable product (MVP). 

User story mapping is something that needs to be approved or overseen by a product owner (PO). As designers, our role is to balance our aesthetics with ease of use for the user and to fight for these values above all else. In contrast, the PO is responsible for balancing the needs of the user with the organizational goals of NewSpring. 


#### What It Looks Like
Each section or page you design will likely have multiple user stories. Within the Agile process these can also be referred to as Epics. 

For a simple sign in page it could look like this:

- As a user, I need to input my email.
- As a user, I need to input my password.
- As a user, I need to be able to reset my password incase I forget it.
- As a user, I need to know if the email or password I input is incorrect.

#### How To Get Started
Hold a kickoff meeting with the key stakeholders at the beginning of the design process. Use post-it notes to arrange and collect the user story statements and prioritize together as a team. Collectively agree on the key stories for each section or epic and then move onto the next phase, Lo-Fi Design.
