# Hi-Fi Design

Hi-Fi stands for High Fidelity and is the second phase of solving the design problem. It requires lo-fi drawings as a pre-cursor so you have confidence in the overall direction.

#### Sketch-A-Standard
We use Sketch by Bohemian Coding for the creation of our hi-fi designs. It is quickly becoming the industry tool of choice for designing interfaces and is an incredibly powerful program.

#### The Artboard Iteration Madness Game
One of the pros to using Sketch over an application like Photoshop is the artboard feature. You can use artboards to very rapidly iterate on isolated aspects of a single design while keeping the original idea intact. This presents two huge advantages:

1. You don’t get caught in an undo trap trying to return to your original idea. 
2. Having many artboards is incredibly useful in sharing the process that got you to the final iteration.

#### The Endgame
Your hi-fi designs will be used to create a prototype and eventually become the assets that are exported and handed off to the development team for production. 

When initially translating your drawings to hi-fi it can be helpful to use stock text and photography in order to move quickly. However, as your designs progress it’s vital to use real content. This helps you as a designer to have real context for how users will interact with the content on the page. It will also set you up for prototyping so that users have a seamless experience.
