# Design Process

At NewSpring we take an iterative approach to design, which is broken into 5 main areas:

1. User Mapping
2. Lo-Fi Design
3. Hi-Fi Design
4. Prototyping
5. User Testing




#### User Story Mapping
User story mapping defines the specific types of people who will be using your product and the types of activities they will be undertaking. 


#### Lo-Fi Design
Draw out initial solutions, eliminating bad ideas before committing time to design software.

#### Hi-Fi Design
Convert your best drawings into high fidelity artboards using Sketch.

#### Prototyping
Translate your hi-fi design into clickable prototypes using Invision. 

#### User Testing
Test your prototype on a group of users. Does it solve the problems identified in user mapping?
