# Lo-Fi Design

Lo-Fi stands for low fidelity, it is the first phase of attempting to solve the problems identified during the user story mapping. 

#### Lo And Behold
Lo-Fi is paper only. No devices, no fancy technology, just pen, paper, and all your bad ideas. It is an incredibly important part of the design process because it enables you to move quickly and communicate basic ideas for validation.

#### All The Bad Ideas Are Belong To Us
We believe in constant iteration and this desire to optimize invades every aspect of our process. Your first attempt at solving the problem is almost never right. The beauty of using paper at this stage is that it makes ideas cheap, so you can go through many iterations very quickly. There are no bad ideas here, because every failed solution serves to call into sharper focus that which is the true solution. 

When you have narrowed down your drawings to 1 or 2 concrete ideas then itâ€™s time to move onto Hi-Fi Design.

#### Tool Up
To help give some context to our drawings we use some basic device templates. These can be found here:
